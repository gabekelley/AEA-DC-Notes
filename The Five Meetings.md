# The Five Meetings
## Kevin Hoffman

- a meeting is something that blends the intentions of people in the meeting
- culture governs what is and isn’t possible in a meeting
- meetings limited by culture, time, ideas and people
- novelty is a part of the process
- novelty will breed innovation
- everyone in the room believes they are doing the right thing
