# Extreme Design
## Derek Featherstone

* When user with low vision zoom in, they see this much of the page
1. 300% - 1/9
2. 400% - 1/16
3. 500% - 1/25

* Consider proximity, pattern of use for low-vision
* Use pattern of use to lead the eye to action
* Solving design issues for for extreme accessibility issues makes the interface better for everyone

* more accessible == fundamentally better design
* [Cell Header](http://examples.simplyaccessible.com/cell-headers)
* choose a super important field or piece of content in the interface and assume someone forgets it, i.e. placeholders in inputs need to stay until user starts typing, or always be available
* focus on hands-free operation
* focus on the problem, not the solution
* Minimum Viable Interaction - the smallest amount of information and functionality needed to complete an interaction
* provide most valuable piece of decision-making information as early as possible
