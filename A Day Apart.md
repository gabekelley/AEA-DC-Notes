# Our Multi-Device Future
## Karen McGrane

- the only thing we really need to know is the size of the browser window
- 91% of consumers say access to content any way is important to them, they just want the information, don’t try and guess
- 90% of people start a task on one device and finish it on another
- having a responsive website makes a unified process for the team

# Responsive Design: A Flexible Foundation
## Ethan Marcotte

- [Festo](http://festo.com)
- “architects are designing their way out of a fixed view of design”
- [The Illusion of Life](https://www.amazon.com/Illusion-Life-Disney-Animation/dp/0786860707)
- [The Illusion of Life](https://vimeo.com/93206523)
- a focus on design principles improves design process
- focus on content first, the Mobilify exercise was actually a bit of a headache
- mobile first is about designing for focus

## Karen McGrane

- by defining more content types and modeling them more fully, we can strike the right balance between flexibility and stability
- content model doesn’t tell you what it looks like
- design patterns don’t tell you what it is
- [Content Display Patterns](http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/)
- content types can apply to many different module mutations
- Structured content store spits out API, can push to React, Static Site Generator or a Native App
- even if content won’t be published from the cis it still must be managed and tracked for review
- content precedes design
- design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration
- not “content then design” or “content or design” its “content and design”

# 
## Ethan Marcotte

- “snap” - adaptive vs. “smooth” - responsive
- a flexible foundation is key, it means considerably less work too
- [The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com)
- target % context = result — make a mixin
- serve the best possible content at any experience
- use breakpoints to defend your content
- design the transaction not the interface
- progressive disclosure, think about the online twitter interface
- [ajax include](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Ajax-Include-Pattern)
- desktop doesn’t mean more
- mobile doesn’t mean less

# Process & Performance
## Ethan Marcotte

* What makes our design responsive? 
* [A Real Web Design Application](http://v4.jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/)
* Creative Pod, visual design vs interaction design
* designers introduce comps
* developers ask a lot of questions
** question layout and how it would adapt
** what part of the design goes away first?
** how does the interface adapt?
* need more questions than there are answers
* integrated design and development efforts _always_ result in stronger digital product
* verify your work “live”
** prototype in code as fast as possible
* rinse, repeat, and refine as needed
* designing in the browser is actually vetting the ideas
* “Deciding in the browsers”
* graphic mockups == catalog of assumptions
* create a budget for additional visual exploration/refinement
* as early as possible, design reviews should focus on the prototype
* incorporate real device in design and in reviews, focusing on interaction challenges, content hierarchy, and performance
* there is no one true canonical view of your comps
* different apps for different tasks
* performance is _everyone’s_ role, not just the developer’s
* [Responsive Design on A Budget](http://clearleft.com/thinks/98)
** look at every decision in the design/build process as something that has consequence
** look at your competitors
** look at your own site
*** how are current load times
*** test on various devices and network conditions
** define an aggressive target, 20% faster? 40% faster? test, test, test
** [Web Page Test](http://webpagetest.org)
** optimize an existing feature of asset on the page
** remove an existing asset
** don’t add the new feature or asset

# Responsive Governance
## Karen McGrane

* anticipate that customers will not be happy at first
* rollouts should be planned carefully then delivered selectively
* responsive is not a project, responsive is a permanent new way of working
