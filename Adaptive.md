# Adaptive: Content, Context, and Controversy
## Karen McGrane

1. responsive web
1.1. responsive web is fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries
2. m-dot
2.1. serving up a completely different website, often contains less information than on its desktop counterpart
2.2. makes teams manage two different sites
3. Adaptive
3.1. serving something different
3.1.2. also structurally different than responsive in that it snaps and is not fluid

…

- adaptive is dynamic serving
- conditional loading which test against the device that is being used
- a bunch of other stuff she then told us we shouldn’t do 95% of the time
