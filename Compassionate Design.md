- the world is wide and the web covers it all, and so many of our users our nothing like our persona stereotypes
- systems arenâ€™t built with users in mind they are built with consumers in mind

- design for failure modes
- stress case instead of edge case, stress finds fractures in your design
- [Perform a Project Premortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)
- subvert every assumption
- make a Designated Dissenter for every project, but change that on every project
- reinforcing meeting the user where they are
