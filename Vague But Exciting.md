# Vague But Exciting
## Dave Rupert

* clickthrough, motion, code prototypes
* code prototype is most valuable because you’re working with the raw of the web, you could possibly already be working with production-ready code
* “If you can’t CodePen it, you probably shouldn’t be doing it”
* Bonus types of prototyping: sketching and blog posts
* blog posts are word prototypes - write out your brainstorm idea with reasoning and logic, that can act as a prototype, mature an idea
* “blogging - the time honored art of complaining”
* [Understanding Comics](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X)
* removal of detail vs. enhancing what is important
* figure out how to be exciting to different people, this is where vagueness works
* get to code as soon as possible, this helps you see the limitations of the platform and see what the real problems actually are
* be fast, keep momentum
* keep experiments away from production as long as possible
** people get surprisingly vocal when you change something that effects what they do
* “find out if its a dumb idea as fast as possible”
* [What went right and what went wrong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/what-went-right-and-what-went-wrong-an-analysis-of-155-postmortems-from-game-development/)
* prescribe an interactive development process and utilize prototypes as a method of proving features and concepts before committing them to your design
* solvable chunks, each chunk informs the next to let you know if it is possible
* “agile becomes beholden to the sprint rather than the problem”
* prototype before committing 
* 4 hour chunk -> 4 in the morning, 4 in the afternoon, 4 in the night, if you don’t get it, try again. If you don’t get it after that, share with coworkers.

* showing someone something that is 80% done is better than showing them something that is 90% done, more success showing a rougher prototype
* “You build the tip of the iceberg and people to come to you and describe the rest”

* validate ideas in prototype as early as possible
* use code
* set a tight deadline
* share what you’ve learned
* designer and developers need to work together
* work in solvable chunks
* every thing you add, adds an extra day
