# Designing with Web Standards in 2016

* we’re still limiting the usefulness of our content mixing layout and content
* nothing is really new; we’ve always had widely different devices and capabilities
* temptation and utility of shortcuts
* we need to design and code for ourselves; dreamweaver and bootstrap have always introduced bloat
* design and build for forward compatibility so that things will still work in the future
** Full separation of structure from presentation and behavior
** valid css
** valid html
** emphasis on structure
** structural labeling of design elements
** dom-based scripting for behavior
** accessibility attributes and testing
* Adaptive Web Design by Aaron Gustafson - about crafting rich experiences with progressive enhancement
* “Instagram added a web component and then Facebook bought them for 2 million, you can’t afford to not pay attention to the web.”
* No one wants to download your app when they go to your website
* Zeldman seems a little out of touch, thinks a lot of folks still have a mobile and a desktop site. Everyone in the room has gone responsive.
* Never underestimate the power of HTML
* Lego approach - make a kit
* Design the doorknob, whats the door look like? Cool door, whats the archway look like? Keep going and you have a cathedral. You may not have the best cathedral but it’ll all work together
* Flexbox further separates content from presentation
